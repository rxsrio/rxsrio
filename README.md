# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natalia Rosario, welcome! I live in the city of SÃ£o Paulo (SP), I'm 21 years old, and I'm a Software Engineering student at the University UNISA. I fell in love with technology at my first encounter.

## About Me

English is my second language, and I have a strong command of the Portuguese language, both written and spoken, as well as an intermediate level of Spanish. I'm always eager to learn new languages; currently, I'm studying Spanish more intensively, and I'm also exploring French, Italian, and German.

I have experience in coordination, in-person and phone sales, customer service, conflict resolution, operational, and administrative roles. In addition to practical knowledge, I have completed high school and taken supplementary courses to enhance my resume.
